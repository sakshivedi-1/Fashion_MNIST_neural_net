# Fashion-MNIST Neural Network

This repository contains a flexible, NumPy-based implementation of a Feedforward Neural Network built from scratch for the Fashion-MNIST classification task.

##  Project Overview
The goal of this project is to classify images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset into 10 categories (e.g., T-shirt, Trouser, Bag) without using high-level frameworks like Keras/PyTorch for the model architecture.

### Key Features:
* **Built from Scratch:** No automatic differentiation or pre-built layers. All forward and backward passes are implemented using `numpy`.
* **Flexible Architecture:** Supports variable number of hidden layers and neuron counts.
* **Multiple Optimizers:** Implementation of 6 optimizers:
    * SGD
    * Momentum
    * Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG)
    * RMSprop
    * Adam
    * Nadam
* **Experiment Tracking:** Integrated with Wandb for hyperparameter sweeps and visualization.
* **Activation Functions:** Support for ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh.

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites
You need Python 3.x and the following libraries:
* `numpy`
* `pandas`
* `matplotlib`
* `wandb` (for experiment tracking)
* `scikit-learn` (for confusion matrix)
* `keras` (only for downloading the dataset)

##  How to Run

### Method: Google Colab
1.  Open the file `Fashion_mnist_neural_net.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2.  **Enable GPU:** Go to `Runtime` > `Change runtime type` > Select `T4 GPU`.
3.  **Run Cells:** Execute the cells sequentially.
    * *Note:* You will be prompted to log in to your Wandb account in the first cell. Copy your API key from [wandb.ai/authorize](https://wandb.ai/authorize) when asked.

##  Usage & Configuration

### Training the Model
To train the model with specific hyperparameters, you can modify the `train()` function call or use the Wandb sweep configuration dictionary in the notebook.

**Example Configuration:**
python
config = {
    'epochs': 20,              
    'hidden_layers': 5,       
    'hidden_size': 128,        
    'activation': 'relu',      
    'optimizer': 'adam',       
    'learning_rate': 0.001,   
    'batch_size': 64,          
    'weight_init': 'xavier',   
    'weight_decay': 0.0005 
}
## Results & Analysis
The project analyzes the performance of different configurations using Parallel Coordinates plots and Correlation matrices generated by Wandb.

Best Optimizer: Adam

Best Activation: ReLU

Test accuracy: 87.82%

Validation accuracy: 89.28%

Evaluation: The final model is evaluated on the test set, and a confusion matrix is plotted to visualize class-wise performance.
